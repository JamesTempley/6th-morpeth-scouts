      Section description:


      Cubs get opportunities to learn and take part in activities such as
      swimming, computing, hiking, sports and exploring. All of these activities
      can earn them badges. Cubs also take part in activity days and camps
      including our group summer camp and autumn residential.


      We meet on Thursdays at 18:15 to 19:45
