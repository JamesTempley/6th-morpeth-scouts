      Section description:


      Cubs get opportunities to learn and take part in activities such as
      swimming, computing, hiking, sports and exploring. All of these activities
      can earn them badges. Cubs also take part in activity days and camps
      including our group summer camp and autumn residential.


      We meet on Thursdays at 18:15 to 19:45

      We currently have spaces in Beavers, Cubs and Scouts. If you would like to
      join us please get in touch.


      Without our volunteers, Scouts would not exist. Volunteering with the
      Scouts helps us continue to give our young people new skills and
      experiences. The more leaders we have, the more young people can be
      provided with these opportunities.


      And it helps you too. Share your skills and gain some new ones. Volunteers
      come from all walks of life and give as little or as much time as they can
      spare.


      We offer ongoing training, awards and recognition.


      Please contact us to find out more.
