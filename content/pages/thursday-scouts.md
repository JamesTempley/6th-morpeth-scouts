      Scouts are the third section of the Scouting Movement. There are over 28
      million members worldwide, and in the UK alone there are over 499,000 boys
      and girls involved in scouting.


      Scouts offer a wide range of interests from Information Technology, street
      sports, camping, entertainment, quad biking, sailing and conservation. As
      well as the outdoor activities, Scouts participate in a balanced programme
      that helps them find out about the world they live in, the importance of
      keeping fit and knowing their abilities.


      Thursday Scouts meet on Thursdays 19:45 to 21:15

      We currently have spaces in Beavers, Cubs and Scouts. If you would like to
      join us please get in touch.


      Without our volunteers, Scouts would not exist. Volunteering with the
      Scouts helps us continue to give our young people new skills and
      experiences. The more leaders we have, the more young people can be
      provided with these opportunities.


      And it helps you too. Share your skills and gain some new ones. Volunteers
      come from all walks of life and give as little or as much time as they can
      spare.


      We offer ongoing training, awards and recognition.


      Please contact us to find out more.
